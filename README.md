# Hotel_Management_System

Developed a Hotel Management System with the help of Java (NetBeans) in front-end and MySQL workbench in 
Back-end and along with this I have integrated Payment Gateway also in this to perform transactions. The ERP itself has 
very neat and clean UI which contains almost all needed features.
